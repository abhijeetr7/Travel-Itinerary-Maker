# Travel-Itinerary-Maker

Travel Itinerary Maker
This is a web application that helps users generate personalized travel itineraries based on their selected destination and interests. It leverages the power of the Gemini API for intelligent itinerary generation and integrates with Firebase Firestore for saving and managing user-specific travel plans.

üß† Concept
The core idea is to simplify trip planning:

Select your City/Country: Choose from a curated list of Indian destinations.

Select your Interests: Pick specific interests (e.g., Nature, Food, Culture) or select "All" for a diverse plan.

Specify Trip Details: Define the duration, start date, number of travelers, and budget level.

Auto-Generate Itinerary: The application automatically creates a day-by-day travel itinerary tailored to your preferences.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
Location Selection: Dropdown with a comprehensive list of popular Indian cities/regions.

Interest-Based Planning: Select from various interests like "Culture & History," "Food & Culinary," "Nature & Outdoors," "Adventure Sports," "Relaxation & Wellness," "Shopping & Fashion," "Art & Museums," "Nightlife & Entertainment," "Family Friendly," "Budget Travel," "Luxury Travel," or "All" for a broad itinerary.

Customizable Trip Duration: Set the number of days for your trip (1 to 14 days).

Detailed Trip Information: Input fields for Start Date, Number of Travelers, and Budget Level.

AI-Powered Itinerary Generation: Utilizes the Gemini API to create a day-by-day plan, including themes, activities, places, and tips.

"Surprise Me!" Mode: Generates a completely random trip plan by selecting a random location, interests, duration, start date, number of travelers, and budget.

Save Itineraries (Firestore): Authenticated users can save their generated itineraries to Firestore for future access.

Load Saved Itineraries (Firestore): View and load previously saved itineraries from a dedicated section.

Edit Itinerary: The generated itinerary output is editable, allowing users to make manual adjustments.

Save Edited Itinerary: Save any manual edits made to the itinerary back to Firestore.

Export as PDF: Download your complete itinerary as a PDF document for offline viewing or printing.

Share via QR Code: Generate a QR code containing the itinerary data, which can be scanned to easily share the plan.

User ID Display: Shows the current user's unique ID for reference, useful for collaborative scenarios or debugging.

Responsive Design: The user interface is designed to be fully responsive and work well on various device sizes.

Custom Modals: Uses custom modals for loading indicators, messages, and QR code display instead of native browser alerts.
